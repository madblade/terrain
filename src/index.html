        Note: this shows 256 (2<sup>8</sup>) points, to make viewing easier, but the real generator uses 16,384
        (2<sup>14</sup>) points. I have a programmer's superstitions about always using powers of 2,
        which are more pleasing to the spirit of the machine.

    <p>Note: the black line indicates the zero contour, which we treat as 'sea level'. Also, this map uses 4,096 (2<sup>12</sup>) points, for speed.</p>

    <h4>Aside: the Planchon-Darboux algorithm</h4>
    <p>The algorithm works by finding the lowest surface with the following two properties:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The surface is everywhere at least as high as the input surface</li>
        <li>Every non-edge point has a neighbour which is lower than it</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To calculate this, we start with an infinitely high surface everywhere
        except on the edge, where we use the original heights. Then, on each iteration,
        we find points which have a neighbour which is lower than them, and set their
        height to their original height, or the height of their lowest neighbour (plus
        a small amount), whichever is higher. We halt when we can go a full iteration
        without changing any point.</p>
    <p>There are various ways of speeding up this algorithm, mostly by tweaking the
        order in which points are visited. For more details, and a proof of
        correctness, you can read <a href="http://horizon.documentation.ird.fr/exl-doc/pleins_textes/pleins_textes_7/sous_copyright/010031925.pdf">the original paper</a>.</p>
